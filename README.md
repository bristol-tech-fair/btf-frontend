# Bristol Tech Fair - Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started

To run this project you will need Node.js and Yarn v1 installed.

[**Install node**](https://nodejs.org/en/)
[**Install Yarn v1**](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

Node handles our build tools, yarn is our package manager and used to run scripts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn storybook`

Starts the design system which you will be able to open on [http://localhost:6006], from here you can view our component library and instructions on how to build and commit new components.

More about storybook [here](https://storybook.js.org/).

## `new=<component-name> yarn component`

Our component generator script, replace `<component-name>` with the actual name of your component. This will take care of creating the correct files and git branches for you.
