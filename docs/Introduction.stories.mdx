# BTF - Design System

Our design system is built with Storybook. If you'd like to learn more about Storybook take a look at their [**docs**](https://storybook.js.org/).

Our aim is build this site with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

If you have any questions please get in touch via the [WebDev101 Slack Channel](https://codehubbs.slack.com/archives/C8GT81UF3)

## Adding components

When contributing to this project, the majority of work will be focused on adding new components.

We want to keep this process consitent so we're always delivering code of the same quality and style.

As such please follow these steps when creating a new component:

<br />

### Step 1. Pick a component to work on

Visit the [Component Library](https://github.com/orgs/bristol-tech-fair/projects/1) project on Github.

<img src={ProjectBoard} />

Select a component from the to do list, and set yourself as an assignee.

<img src={AssignYourself} />

<br />
<br />

### Step 2. Set up git branch and remote

Once you've picked your component and assigned yourself on Github you need to create a branch to work on.

First make sure you're currently set to the `develop` branch.

```sh
git checkout develop
```

Next create and checkout a new branch using the name of your component:

```sh
git checkout -b component/<component-name>
```

_\*Replace `<component-name>` with the actual name of your component._

<br />

Finally, set up a remote for your branch using the following command:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```

<br />
<br />

### Step 3. Generate a new component

To make sure everyone's setting up their files correctly, I've created a script to generate the correct files for a new component.

```sh
yarn component <component-name>
```

_\*Replace `<component-name>` with the actual name of your component. As shown below..._

<img src={ComponentCommand} />

After executing this command you should see something like this printed out in your terminal:

<img src={ComponentCommandResult} />

This command is doing a number of things:

1. Create and checkout a new git branch with the component name you passed in.
2. Creates a new folder in `src/components/` with the name of the component.
3. Builds a set of empty starter files for your component.
4. Commits all these new changes to git and pushes them to the repo.

This takes out a lot of the boring set up and allows you to start building your component immediatley!

<br />

### Step 4. Start building!

Now the files are set up you can start building your component.

This process will vary depdending on the type and complexity of the component you're building.

So instead of giving you a detailed walkthrough we've listed what you should be putting in each of your new files.

The command from the previous step will have created a folder in `src/components/` that looks something like this:

<img src={ComponentExample} />

_\*`Example` will be replaced with the name of your component. I'm also using a custom icon set so yours may look a bit different._

<br />
<hr />

**Example.jsx** - This is the main component file. It contains the JSX, state, PropTypes and hooks the component uses.

```js
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { ExampleWrapper } from './Example.styles';

const Example = ({ value }) => {
  return (
    <ExampleWrapper>
      <p>{value}</p>
    </ExampleWrapper>
  );
};

Example.propTypes = {
  value: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

export default Example;
```

<hr />

**Example.stories.jsx** - This file renders the component, along with any props you
pass to it, within storybook.

You'll be able to see "Example" in the left hand side
to see what this looks like.

```js
import React from 'react';
import Example from './Example';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Example',
  component: Example
};

export const HelloWorld = () => <Example value="Hello world!" />;
```

<hr />

**Example.styles.js** - We're using [**styled-components**](https://styled-components.com/) to style our components, it's a CSS in JS library which is why you won't see any CSS/SCSS files in this project.

The styles you create in this file should only be for this component. Global styles are defined by our [**theme**](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/theme-structure--page).

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';

export const ExampleWrapper = styled.div`
  padding: var(--small-space);
  border: 0.1rem solid var(--logopink);
`;
```

_\* If you've never used styled components before make sure to read their documentation and feel free to ask questions on the WebDev101 Slack channel._

<br />
<hr />

**Example.test.jsx** - Arguably the most important file of them all! This is where we test our components behaviour and functionality.

We're using Jest and React Testing Library, the default create-react-app test packages.

If you've never written tests with these tools take a look at this [**tutorial**](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-library).

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

import Example from './Example';

describe('Example', () => {
  test('renders Example component', () => {
    render(<Example value="Hello" />);

    expect(screen.getByText('Hello'));
  });
});
```

<hr />

**index.js** - All this file does is import and then export the `Example.jsx`.

This is a stylistic choice and doesn't affect functionality.

When it comes to adding this component to pages it means we can import it with `'./components/Example'` instead of `'./components/Example/Example'`.

```js
import Example from './Example';

export default Example;
```

<br />

### Step 5. Commit regularly

While you're building your component make sure to commit regularly.

Try to use semantic commit messages so it's obvious what's included in your commit.

```
feat: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
fix: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
docs: (changes to the documentation)
style: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
refactor: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
test: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
chore: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
```

For example when you've added tests, your commit may look like this:

```
git commit -m "test: added test for Example component"
```

<br />

### Step 6. Push your changes and create a pull request

Once you've got all your files ready, push your changes to Github with:

```
git push
```

You should then visit the [**Github repo**](https://github.com/bristol-tech-fair/btf-frontend). A message to create a pull request should be visible, as shown below:

<img src={PushCommits} />

Click the **Compare & pull request** button, it'll take you to this page:

<img src={AssignReviewer} />

There's a few things to do here:

1. Link to the issue. Go to the issue you assigned yourself to earlier, it'll have a mumeric Id: like #14 in the example.
2. Type `Closes #14` as the first line, this will link the pull request to your issue.
3. Provide a description of the work you've done, please be descriptive here.
4. Assign `robtf9` as a reviewer. That's my account and I'll check over the code before merging it into our main branch.

<br />

### Step 6. Your done!

Unless there are requested changes to your PR, your work is now finished! Thanks for your contribution and feel free to pick a new component to work on.
